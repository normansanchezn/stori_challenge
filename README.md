# Android Stori Technical Test

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the Android Stori Technical Test. The challenge was to create a banking application that allows user registration, login, and provides bank information such as balance and transaction history.

## Challenge Details
The application is expected to fulfill the following requirements:

- **Registration**: Implement an onboarding process including user personal data collection and taking an identification photo.

The following issues needed to be addressed:
- Validate user data and password during login.
- Display home screen upon successful login.
- Implement registration process including user data collection, ID photo capture, and display success message.
- Store collected data in Firebase database.
- Create test data in Firebase for testing user login without account creation.

## Points to Evaluate
